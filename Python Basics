#2. Write a program for a Single line comment and multi-line comments 
# Single line Comment
''' Multi Line Comments are used to
    write the comments in more than
    one line'''


#3.  Define variables for different Data Types int, Boolean, char, float, double and print on the Console. 
a = 10
print(a, type(a))
b = True 
print(b, type(b))
#Python does not have an explicit char or double data type like some other languages
#char is represented as a single-character string (str).
#double is represented as a float since Pythonâ€™s float is equivalent to a double-precision floating-point number in other languages.
c = 's '
print(c, type(c))
d = 97.06
print(d, type(d))
e = 87.9876543
print(e, type(e))


#4. Define the local and Global variables with the same name and print both variables and understand the scope of the variables
# Global variable
x = 44  
def my_function():
    # Local variable with the same name
    x = 54  
    print("Local x:", x)  # This will print the local variable inside the function
# Printing the global variable
print("Global x:", x)  
my_function()
# Printing global variable again to check 
print("Global x after function call:", x)
